* Counter CRUD MVP
** Creating Counters
*** DONE Configure the redux store
*** DONE Create a component that will house the form  
    The form needs to specify the counter needs a "Label", a number in minutes that the timer will run for, the color (see below), and the icons.
    {
      label: string,
      minutes: number,
      color: 1...7,
      icon: ?
    }
    colors and icons can wait.
*** DONE Make a rudimentary form that will create a counter in the store
* UI Cloning (further out in time)
** TODO get a screenshot of the old app and get the exact color choices
** TODO find out where the icons are from, or just steal them and vectorize them
** TODO get screenshots of all the hues in the background to recreate the color scheme
